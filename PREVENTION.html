    <h2>Prophylaxis in HIV</h2>
    <p>Prophylaxis is a medical agent or substance which is given to a person to prevent infection or disease
</p>
      <li type="none">Prophylaxis in HIV include:-</li>
      <ul>
        <li> Post-Exposure Prophylaxis</li>

<section id="Pre-ExposureProphylaxisPrevention">
    <h2><b><u>Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis(PrEP)</u></b></h2>
    <p>PrEP, or Pre-exposure prophylaxis, is medicine people at risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use. PrEP can stop HIV from taking hold and spreading throughout your body.
    </p>
    <p>On-demand PrEP involves taking 2 pills, 2-24 hours before a possible sexual exposure to HIV and then continuing to take 1 pill each day until 2 days after their last possible sexual exposure. The only PrEP medication approved for on-demand use is 
      <b>Truvada</b></p>
    <div id="picture_frame">

    </div>
    <p>PrEP is a reliable and effective way to prevent HIV infection. </p>

    <h3>Why Take PrEP?</h3>
    <p>PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV when taken as indicated.</p>
    <p>PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% when taken as prescribed. Among people who inject drugs, it reduces the risk by at least 74% when taken as prescribed. PrEP is much  less effective when it isn't taken consistently</p>

    <h3>Why would I take PrEP?</h3>
      <p>There are different reasons you may start taking PrEP. Examples include:-</p>
      <ul>
        <li> If you are HIV-negative and in a sexual relationship with a partner who is HIV infected</li>
        <li>If you are HIV-negative and have multiple sex partners and do not consistently use condoms</li>
        <li>If you engage in sex work with people with an unknown HIV status to make a living</li>
        <li>If you inject drugs and may be sharing syringes and needles</li>
        <li>If you have gotten sexually transmitted infections repeatedly</li>
        <li>If you find yourself using post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) repeatedly</li>
        <li>If you have had sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs regularly </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Does it work?</h3>
    <p>PrEP is highly effective if it is taken consistently and correctly. This means taking a pill every day as described by your provider. Taking PrEP regularly helps to build a protective layer within your bodythat can protect when people are
    exposed to HIV.</p>

    <h3>Are there any side effects?</h3>
    <p>PrEP is safe to take! Some people who take PrEP may experience different side effects for a short time, which are common when taking other medications, and these may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Vomiting
        <li>Nausea or stomach discomfort</li>
        <li>Diarrhea (running stomach)</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
    </ul>
    <p> These side effects are usually not serious and go away over time. If you are taking PrEP, tell your health care provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> PrEP protects you against HIV but not against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or other types of infections. Combining PrEP with condoms will reduce your risk of getting other STIs.</p>

     <h3>If I start using PrEP does that mean I do not need to use condoms with my partner(s)? </h3>
    <p>You should still use condoms! Even though taking PrEP regularly will prevent you from getting infected with HIV, it <b>does NOT</b>protect against pregnancy or other types of sexually transmitted infections like herpes, gonorrhea or syphilis. It is therefore always recommended to continue to use condoms unless you are in a monogamous relationship with a trusted partner.</p>

    <h3>What if I forget to take PrEP one day?</h3>
    <p>If you forget to take a single PrEP dose, just take it as soon as possible within the same 12-hour period. But if you forget during that time, there is no need to double dose the next day, just keep taking it normally. Forgetting one dose occasionally isn’t the end of the world – the important thing is to get back into the daily routine. If you start forgetting more frequently, PrEP will stop working and you need to talk to your medical provider</p>

    <h3>When does it start working once I take it?</h3>
    <p>Once you start taking it, it takes about seven days (seven doses) to have adequate levels in your body to be effective. PrEP should be taken once a day for as long as someone wants to be protected against the risk of getting HIV. During the initial seven-day period, you need to adopt safe sexual practices, such as not having vaginal or anal intercourse, or using condoms for all vaginal and anal intercourse.</p>

    <h3>How long can you take it?</h3>
    <p>You can take PrEP as long as you need to protect yourself against HIV. Discuss with your health care worker on any plans to stop taking PrEP if any of the reasons or circumstances in your life change. If you test HIV-positive at any time, you will need to stop taking PrEP and will need to start taking HIV treatment. </p>

    <h3>Can I take PrEP intermittently? </h3>
    <p>You can take PrEP for the periods you know you are at risk of acquiring HIV, stop taking it when you are not at risk, and begin again if the risk presents itself again—this is sometimes called seasonal PrEP. Seasonal PrEP just refers to using PrEP for certain periods (months, weeks, etc.) that you may be a risk. It is important to talk to a health provider about your plans for their guidance. </p>

    <h3>Can I drink alcohol when taking PrEP?</h3>
    <p>Yes! There is no interaction known between alcohol and PrEP. It is advised to take PrEP during the day, like in the morning after waking up, to ensure the times do not collide with the time that you mostly consume alcohol to reduce the risk of forgetting to take it. But you can choose another time that works for you. PrEP can be taken with or without food. Taking PrEP with food may help with swallowing the pill and with some stomach complaints if you have any</p>

    <h3>What if I’m pregnant?</h3>
    <p>Being pregnant does NOT disqualify you from being eligible for PrEP. You can start and take PrEP during pregnancy and the breastfeeding period without any harm to the mother or the baby. It is safe and effective to take PrEP while pregnant. </p>

    <h3>How Do You Get PrEP?</h3>
    <p>If you think PrEP may be right for you, visit your doctor or health care provider. PrEP is only available by prescription. Any health care provider licensed to write prescriptions can prescribe PrEP; specialization in infectious diseases or HIV medicine is not required.</p>
    <p>Because PrEP is for people who are HIV-negative, you’ll have to get an HIV test before starting PrEP and you may need to get other tests to make sure it’s safe for you to use PrEP.</p>
    <p>If you take daily oral PrEP, you’ll need to see a health care provider every 3 months for repeat HIV tests, prescription refills, and follow-up. If you use injectable PrEP, you’ll need to see a healthcare provider every two months for an HIV test and the injections.</p>

<section id="Post-ExposureProphylaxisPrevention">
    <h2><b><u>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis(PEP)</u></b></h2>
    <p>HIV PEP, or post-exposure prophylaxis, is a short course of HIV medicines taken very soon after a possible exposure to HIV to prevent the virus from taking hold in your body.
    </p>
    <p>You must start it within 72 hours (3 days) after a possible exposure to HIV, or it won’t work. Every hour counts!</p>
    <p>PEP should be used only in emergency situations. It is not meant for regular use by people who may be exposed to HIV frequently.</p>

    <h3>Who should consider taking PEP?</h3>
    <p>PEP may be prescribed for people who are HIV negative or do not know their HIV status, and who in the last 72 hours:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>May have been exposed to HIV during sex</li>
        <li>Shared needles or other equipment (works) to inject drugs</li>
        <li>Were sexually assaulted</li>
        <li>May have been exposed to HIV at work (occupational exposure)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you think you were recently exposed to HIV, talk to your health care provider or an emergency room doctor about PEP right away.</p>
      <p>A health care worker who has a possible exposure to HIV should seek medical attention immediately.</p>

      <h3>When should PEP be started?</h3>
    <p>PEP must be started within 72 hours (3 days) after a possible exposure to HIV. The sooner PEP is started after a possible HIV exposure, the better. Every hour counts. According to research, PEP will most likely not prevent HIV infection if it is started more than 72 hours after a person is exposed to HIV.</p>
    <p>If you are prescribed PEP, you will need to take the HIV medicines every day for 28 days.</p>

    <h3>How well does PEP work?</h3>
    <p>PEP is effective in preventing HIV when it is taken correctly, but it is not 100% effective. The sooner PEP is started after a possible HIV exposure, the better. Every hour counts. The exact effectiveness of PEP is difficult to measure, but observational research suggests that PEP can reduce the risk of getting HIV by more than 80%. The effectiveness is highly dependent on adherence (taking PEP every day for 28 days) and in the case of non-occupational exposure, no further exposures to HIV. Effectiveness is likely much higher than 80% if PEP is used consistently and correctly, as prescribed.</p>
    <p>While taking PEP, it is important to keep using other HIV prevention methods, such as consistently and properly using condoms with sex partners and using only new, sterile needles and syringes when injecting drugs.</p>

    <h3>Does PEP cause side effects?</h3>
    <p>The HIV medicines used for PEP may cause side effects in some people. The side effects can be treated and are not life-threatening. If you are taking PEP, talk to your health care provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.</p>

    <h3>Can You Take PEP When You Are Pregnant or Breastfeeding?</h3>
    <p>Yes. PEP is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, consult with a health care provider about PEP and which PEP regimen is right for you.</p>

    <h3>Can You Take PEP Every Time You Have a Potential Exposure to HIV?</h3>
    <p>No. PEP should be used only in emergency situations. It is not intended to replace regular use of other HIV prevention methods. If you feel that you might be exposed to HIV frequently, talk to your health care professional about PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis).</p>
